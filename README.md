# TestAlgorithm
This project is created to test given 2 different word tables with selected data structure, sort algorithm, 
and search algorithm to calculate complexities like elapsed time and used memory.
Then sets these calculated complexity values  to destination variables of [TestAlgorithmResult Project](https://github.com/AhmetEminSaglik/TestAlgorithmResult).
